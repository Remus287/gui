total of 4-5 motes
each mote has 1 teensy
the packets will be stored in a char buffer (structure of packets tentative)
each digit identify mote/teensy
    digit depends on last static ip of each teensy
~50 sensors, indefinite num of actuators
config is now csv (easier to handle)
config is read once in startup operation
In the SD card, there are 2 files:
	the master config csv file
	MoteNumber.txt which is used to set the last digit of static ip, and to identify which sensors and actuators in the master config belong to this mote
Instructions to teensy: (struct) 
{
	PIN number (uint_8) 
	state number (uint_8)
	actuator type (uint_8) //make a enum for actuator type (made into an int) 
}

Data retrieving (array)
{
{pin num (uint_8t), measurements (float)},

}
sampling rate of measurements must be at least 100 hz
    4.1 can already do 1 Ghz (base is 600 Mhz)
might consider error checking with receiving Data
multi-connection from clients but 1 single server
