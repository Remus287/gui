Functional:
- CRITICAL: ACK/NACK indicator on actuators. Keep current "last sent command" indicator
- Make the ABORT button work. There should be a way to load an abort script from the GUI, 
    and a warning if you try to run a sequence with no abort script loaded
- Forbid arming without a loaded config, and forbid sequences from running disarmed
- Get rid of all the submit buttons, "upload" should inherently submit
- There should be connected indicators
- If a box has sent a packet in the last 1.5s, assume it's there. Otherwise, assume it's disconnected
- Buttons should be greyed out / unclickable when system is disarmed OR disconnected
- Verify autoseq with actuators before autoseq runs
- Arm/Disarm button spamming while app.py is not running will lead to all commands being received on restart ;; check this for actuator presses as well, we default to disarm so fixing the first issue should fix the second but not a good aproach

Stylistic:
- Make it look nice!
- Make the sensor graphs a 2xN grid
