1.  To install GTK and it's dependencies, run the "windows_gtk_install.ps1" script AS AN ADMINISTRATOR
1A. If this script throws an error for some reason, defer to the instructions here: https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
2.  To run the GUI, run the run_gtk.ps1 with the filename as a parameter
    E.g. win10_gtk.ps1 gui.py

2. Open the terminal, and run "brew install pygobject3 gtk+3" (without quotations)
3. Run python3 code as normal

Honestly, if you use linux, you'll probably figure this one out.
Same Instructions as above: https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
