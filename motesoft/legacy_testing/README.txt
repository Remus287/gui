This directory contains various test scripts, outdated versions of things, and other code which is not meant to be used as MoTE firware
Nothing in legacy_testing should be considered stable, and only used at your own risk.
A lot of it probably doesn't work, and a lot of it isn't well understood.

Contents, as far as known:

Example_Code: Contains an example of ADC firmware from the manufacturer. Probably a good place to stash any other manufacturer examples we want to keep on hand
firmware for teensy (OLD. DO NOT USE): I do not know what this code does or if it works. The folder says DO NOT USE, and I'm going to take its advice
firmware_for_teensy_legacy: Don't actually use this on the MoTE, but the code in here does seem to work to some extent and should be considered a prototype and/or experimental
test_arduino_sensors: test/example code, functionality and status unknown
test_arduino_sensors: test/example code, functionality and status unknown
