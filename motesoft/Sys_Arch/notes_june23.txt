teensy needs to just spit out 100 hz but receiving packets is not time sensitive
hard os deadline for sending data (i.e. cancel commands needs to be sent within 100 ms)
    debate tcp or udp for sending commands to gurantee delivery?
however, soft deadline for receiving data packets

there might be discreprenancy between python sending enum and arduino sending c struct

create a readme, needs a requirements.txt to keep track what packages needed

need a list of functions that benk needs to create
need a list of all types of sensors: 

debate between using gui: pygobject3 or tk.
